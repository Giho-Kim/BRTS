# BRTS
Python implementation of Balanced Linear Contextual Bandits (BRTS) [[1]](#1), Thompson Sampling for Contextual Bandits with Linear Payoffs (LinTS) [[2]](#2), and Random baseline.

## Usage
With the default setting, you can run experiment as follows:
```
python main.py ./configs/ALGO_TO_USE.json
```
